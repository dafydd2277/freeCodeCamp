# ES6

- `use strict;`
- `let` vs. `var` - `let` has stricter scoping.
- `const` makes a variable read-only after it's set.
- `Object.freeze(obj)` freezes the object `obj` so that its contents can't be
  changed.
- `array1.concat(array2)` combines arrays 1 and 2.
- The [rest parameter][rest] creates an array of variable number of incoming
arguments. `function myFunction(...args) {}` will allow `myFunction()` to take
  a variable number of arguments which are then stored in a function-scoped
  array called `args[]`.
- [Destructuring assignments][destr] - Make sure the deconstructed variables
come after the references.
- [JavaScript promises][promises]
- [Asynchronous "Promise" functions][async]. These would be good for calling
resources from the server.
- And hey! The next lesson handles the [Promise.then()][then] constructions you
saw in the various solutions for grabbing pages.
