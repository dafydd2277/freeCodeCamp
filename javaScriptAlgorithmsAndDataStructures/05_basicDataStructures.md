# Basic Data Structures

- [link][]
- Use the 'delete' [keyword][] to delete a key:value pair in a JS Object:
`delete object.property`.
- [Does a given key (or "property" in JS vocabulary) exist][key]?
  - Use `object.hasOwnProperty(property)`.
  - The construction `<property> in <object>`, where "property" is a string and
  "object" is a named object, also works.
- [Object.keys(obj)][object] returns an array of the first level keys of an
object.
