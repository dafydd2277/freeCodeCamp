# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

Here are my notes for the [Free Code Camp][fcc] [course][]. There's a
lot here to get up to speed on.

I got as far as [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting][ias] before looking to see
if they specifically had something on the [Document Object Model (DOM)][dom].
They don't, and the whole point of my relearning JS is so I can bodge together
a client-side content manager/markdown interpreter. So, I switched over to
https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp for that. I may go back to FCC if
I go somewhere that needs lots of JS coding.
